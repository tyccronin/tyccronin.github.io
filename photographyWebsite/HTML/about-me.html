                        Hi there! 
                        <br>
                        <br> 
                        My name is Ty Cronin, and I love capturing nature.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I've always been an artist at heart, and started taking up photography
                        as a hobby when I was a young teenager - Borrowing my Dad's camera, and 
                        taking pictures of just about anything and everything I could pose for
                        a cool shot. Being such a shy boy, I wasn't much for talking to others
                        or interested in using people as my photo subjects. It was from this
                        little quirk of mine that I turned to nature photography.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Nature is so full of diversity in all aspects, and best of all, I didn't have to
                        talk to it! I've had the pleasure of travelling to a couple different 
                        beautiful locations in North America where I found ample subjects to
                        photograph. From the Rocky Mountains, to the majesty of Winter in Winnipeg,
                        I've filled this website with all the best from my portfolio. I'd love nothing
                        more than to inspire fellow hobbiests and artists everywhere with the beauty of
                        nature that I've managed to capture. So please! Stay a while, and enjoy!
                        <br>
